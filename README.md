Hello, this is my second ever project.

How do I play the game?

1. Your mouse cursor determines where the fruit will fall.
2. Press your left mouse button to make the fruit fall.
3. That is it! Aim for other fruits of the same kind to merge
   and see how many you can manage to merge before your screen is full of fruits!
